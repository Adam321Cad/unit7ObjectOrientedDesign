1:The relationship between deck and card is that deck has cards.
it is an Aggregation relationship

2:it has 6 cards

3: The ranks would have to have cards 1-10 and all of the face cards
in them. the point values would then be assigned in the same order the ranks
were eg: 1 has 11 points 2 has 2 an so on. Then in suits you simple put
hearts diamonds spades and clubs.

4:it does for ranks and pointvalue but the order does no matter for suits
