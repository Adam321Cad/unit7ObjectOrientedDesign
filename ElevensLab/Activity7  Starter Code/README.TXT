1: i would need a table with a standard deck of cards. I would need
9 spots to put my cards

2: so you would need an array that holds 9 card objects. You would draw cards to fill any empty spots
in the array. Then each time cards are picked you cheack to make sure that it is a valid pair. The replace
button should also send everything in the board back into the deck and draw 9 new cards.

3: all of the methods seem to be there but not all of the methods are implemented yet as in they do not
have any code.

4a: it is in the elevensBoard() and the newGame()

4b: isLegal and anotherPlayIsPossible should call them.

4c: it will return and arraylist with 0 1 3 6 7

4e: the anotherPlayIsPossible so to know should the game continue.
