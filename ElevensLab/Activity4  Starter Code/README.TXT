Activity 4:
question 3: you would need k to equal 2 then 1 then 2 then 1





Activity 5:
Buggy1:
Constructor or Method (isEmpty()):
Describe a Possible Code Error:
this could be because when they did the assert (size == 0); they might have does != instead

Buggy2:
Constructor or Method (deal()):
Describe a Possible Code Error:
the error here might be because in the card deal method they put the size-- after the return statment

Buggy3:
Constructor or Method (shuffle()):
Describe a Possible Code Error:
they did not shuffle useing a random k value. The shuffle is wrong and predictable
______________________________________________________________________________
Buggy4:
Constructor or Method (deal());
describe a possible code Error:
they did !(isEmpty()) instead of just plain (isEmpty()) in the if statment.

Buggy5:
Constructor or Method (shuffle()):
Describe a Possible Code Error:
When chooseing the range for the random number they should have just but cards.size() as the parameter.
anything else can have an error.




Activity 6:
1: you can play a 5 and a 6. there are 2 fives so there are two diffrent ways you can make the same play
2:they do there is no other way to win the game
3:There is no stratagy to this game because for every card say 4 for example there is only one other card that
can be choosen to have it equal 11. So if there was for example two 4s and one 5 it does not matter which 4 you
use because you can get another 5 later. They are all identical. If there was say a pair of 4 and 5 and a 
9 and 2 it would be no difference which one you pick first.
