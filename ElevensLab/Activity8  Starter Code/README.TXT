1: in both you need to pick out cards whos point value add up to
a certain number. That number however is diffrerent and the amount
of cards on the board is different as well.

2:in the elevensBoard contructor they used super and used that to pass
in all of the instance variables.

3:the abstract methods are isLegal and anotherPlayIsPossible. And no
it does not cover all of the differences. one of the differences was
the size of the board. No matter what you bas into the elevesboard the
size of the board will be 9. assuming that you will make a 13board
class however, as longas you change the board size then yes it does
account for all of the differences.
